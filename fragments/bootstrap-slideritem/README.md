# Bootstrap Slider Item

This fragment provides a good example of a CARD ready to be used inside the Bootstrap Carousel. It includes configurations to show or not Caption and to show or not a Button that will connect with the Display Page Template of the corresponding collection item. It also adds a Image as the background of the card, with the Caption and Button on top of it.
