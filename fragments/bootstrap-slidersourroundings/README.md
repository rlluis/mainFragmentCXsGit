# Bootstrap Slider Sourroundings

This fragment provides the required divs that compound a Bootstrap Carousel. You need to add first this fragment, then a Collection Display Fragment inside its main drop zone and finally a Bootstrap-SliderItem so you can map each item's main image, caption and link in an easy way.

This fragment depends on JQUERY so depending on the version of Liferay you are using you will either configure JQuery addition through Instance Settings or you will add JQuery dependency through a JS Client Extension that will be then added to the corresponding Page where you are using this fragment (directly into it or to its Master Page)
