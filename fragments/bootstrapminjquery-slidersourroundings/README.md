# BootstrapMinJQuery Carousel Fragment

This fragment provides the required divs that compound a Bootstrap Carousel. You need to add first this fragment, then a Collection Display Fragment inside its main drop zone and finally a Bootstrap-SliderItem so you can map each item's main image, caption and link in an easy way.

We have eliminated here the JQuery dependency by adding directly into the fragment a implementation of the bootstrap carousel, similar to Liferay's OOTB Carousel.
